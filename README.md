The Week 3 internship project assigned by CODTECH involved designing and developing a personal portfolio webpage. This project aimed to help interns build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS by creating a visually appealing, responsive, and functional webpage that showcases their personal and professional profile. The main deliverable for this task was a single-page responsive portfolio website with proper navigation, designed purely using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling and responsiveness. This task is an important milestone for any web development intern as it lays the groundwork for building more complex websites in the future.

Tools & Technologies Used

1. HTML5: For structuring content like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
   
2. CSS3: For styling the content, layout formatting, color theming, spacing, and responsiveness.
   
3. Responsive Design Techniques: Using CSS @media queries to adapt the layout across different devices like mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   
4. VS Code / Any Code Editor: For writing and editing HTML & CSS code.

Features Implemented

A navigation bar with links like Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact.

An introduction section with the intern's name, title, and a short paragraph describing their background and career goal.

A display image, generally a profile picture or symbolic illustration, aligned using Flexbox.

Call-to-action buttons such as "Hire Me" and "Let’s Talk" to simulate real-world interaction.

Fully responsive layout using media queries, ensuring the website looks good on both small and large screens.

 The Week 3 Internship Project – Personal Portfolio Webpage – was a valuable learning experience. It helped me understand the real-world application of frontend development concepts and allowed me to showcase my creativity, technical skills, and attention to detail.This webpage will serve as the first version of my personal portfolio, and I plan to continuously improve it by adding new sections like projects, certifications, and a downloadable resume. As I move forward in my journey to become a full-stack developer, this foundation will be extremely helpful.Overall, this project not only met the expectations set by CODTECH but also gave me a chance to express myself professionally on the web.
